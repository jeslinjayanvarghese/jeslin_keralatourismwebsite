<div class="about">
<h2 style="color:crimson">About</h2>
  <p>The district of Palakkad known as the granary of Kerala, is a land of valleys, hillocks, rivers, forests, mountain streams, dams and irrigation projects. Situated at the foot of the Western Ghats , this is the gateway to Kerala from the north.Palakkad derives its name from the Malayalam words Pala ( Alsteria scholaris) and Kadu (forest) which goes to prove that this place was once a beautiful stretch of forests covered with the sweet scented flowers of the Pala tree.</p>
  <p>
    The land of Palmyra trees and paddy fields - thats how Palakkad is often referred to as  Palakkadu and Palghat are the other names of this place that entices you with its myriad forms of attractions. There are temples thronged by a number of devotees with faith in their hearts and sheen in their eyes; there are wildlife sanctuaries nurturing the lives of a number of animals, reptiles and birds; there is a historical fort that stands today to narrate its past and there are gramams where the inhabitants still follow the age old custom of passing down the vedas verbally. Attractions like these are abundant in Palakkad so you can expect to get a variety of entertainment options during your trip.
  </p>
  <p>
    Palakkad lies at the foot of gigantic Western ghats , on the border of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This district with mountains, forest and fertile valleys, rivers and mountain streams are rich in flora and fona. The Sahya ranges bordering the region and the 20 mile gap in the mountains exert a dominant influence on the climate of the region. Many rivers that flow in the Bharatapuzha, the life line of Kerala, arise from these mountains. In olden days, Palakkad was known as Paalakkattusery. Etymologists trace the word Palakkadu from Paalainilam, meaning dry area. Palakkad has a long history dating back to the Paleololithic period. A large number of megalithic relics have been discovered from here.
  </p>
<p>
  This salubrious city is today a magnet for tourists, businessmen and professionals. For many of them it captures the essence of Kerala and is an ideal springboard from which to venture into the rest of the state. The city sprang into the nation’s consciousness in 2011 with the discovery of a hoard of treasure at Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Hundreds of valuable items had accumulated over the centuries as gifts from the rulers of Travancore to the temple and is said to be worth over Rs 1 trillion. A rich legacy indeed!
</p>
<h2 style="color:crimson">Breif History of Palakkad</h2>
<p>
  How Palakkad derived its name is a bit of a matter of choice since there are so many opinions and views tracing its etymology. According to one version, “Pala” (barren) along with “kadu” (jungle) joined together to give the land its name.Yet another version says that it was with respect to the Jain Temple of the place that led to its name, Palighat, since Pali is the sacred language of the Jains. Palighat subsequently gave way to Palakkad. The most believed version is the third one according to which Palakkad owes its name to the Pala trees that once occupied its major portion. As for the history of Palakkad goes, very little is known about it. Evidence in the form of relics suggests that Palakkad existed during the Paleolithic age. First millennium AD saw the Perumal rulers exercising their control over the land. This control was later disintegrated into smaller divisions by the Perumal governors. Accounts of William Logan, the Scottish author of the Malabar Manual also mentions Palakkad as one of the Malabar regions that was captured by the Pallavas of Kanchi.
</p>
<p>
  Another record describes a war that was fought by the king of Palakkad in 988 AD to stop the invading army of King of Kongunadu at Chittur. The victory of Palakkad in that war is still celebrated in the form of a festival. In 1757, yet another invasion by the Zamorins made the then Raja seek the help of Mysore ruler, Hyder Ali. Hyder Ali obliged and eventually secured Palakkad for himself and later his son, Tipu Sultan. However, with the defeat of Tipu in the third Anglo Mysore war of 1792, Palakkad, along with other Malabar territories (belonging to Tipu) passed off to the British. The British made Palakkad a part of the Malabar District of Madras Presidency which post independence became a part of the Madras state. In 1956, when Kerala came into existence, Palakkad became a part of it.
